## Setting up a virtual environment: Under Run/Debug Configurations, set the following values:
## Script path > whatever directory the main.py file is stored in
## Environment Variables > "PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1;STEAM_API_KEY=25F01C7C51803E91E331CBAD669F542C"
## Python Interpreter > this needs to be Python 3.9
## Working Direcotry > same directory as your Script Path
##
## Navigate to PyCharm's terminal and run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
## A yellow bar should appear near the top of the PyCharm window prompting you to download required packages.
## Select download and everything the project needs to run Flask will be installed.
